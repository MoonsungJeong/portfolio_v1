                            Hi! I’m Moonsung, a Korean web developer based in Brisbane, Australia
                            <br><br>
                            I first got into computers because of computer games. While at high school, I became curious to know more about how the games work. I started just by using a game editor to make a modified version of Warcraft III. This is why I decided to learn more about computer engineering in university.
                            <br><br>
                            I now have a bigger passion for computers and coding, because I have learned that coding has unlimited possibilities and that I can make anything I imagine by coding. I always do my best to learn new languages and technologies to improve my skills. I also like thinking of ways to combine IT with other fields to add creative value.
                        </P>

                        <h3>Hackathon & Competition</h3>
                        <p>I participated in a hackathon (24 hours coding competition) and a product design competition (making solutions to real-world problems with IT technology) in university. I enjoyed challenging myself to create something new, learning new technologies, and meeting new people. Although I didn’t win, it became a good motivation to continue improving my abilities.</p><br>
                        <h3>Education</h3>
                        <p>I went to Sejong University in Korea and graduated with bachelor’s degree in Information and Communication Engineering. While I was studying, I did many projects that taught me a lot about computer programming. I made codec (with Fourier transform) which is used in many fields. I worked as a team leader in a school project that analyzed differences between Live streaming and video streaming in a network subject. </p><br>
                        <h3>Opentutorials & Youtube</h3>
                        <p>Since coming to Australia, I have done additional self-study to learn more about web development. I did this with Opentutorials (non-profit coding community in Korea), many programming YouTube channels, and stackoverflow. I have learned to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript.</p><br>
